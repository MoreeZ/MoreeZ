<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in both creative design and problem-solving. My journey began with a love for art, which evolved into interests like photography, and web design. At 16, I taught myself to code using YouTube and freeCodeCamp, building everything from Discord bots to full-scale e-commerce sites with React.js and CSS.

In college, I consistently earned top grades in programming modules and worked part-time as a programming tutor for two years. I worked for Trinity to develop a language-learning app that became the focus of my Master's dissertation and was pilot tested in Irish primary schools with great results. I now lead its ongoing development part-time, managing a team of engineers.

I've interned at Bloomberg and Amazon, gaining experience in large-scale development, sustainable engineering, and cross-functional collaboration. These roles deepened my understanding of enterprise software practices and improved my ability to communicate technical ideas across diverse teams.
